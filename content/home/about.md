# About Me

Hi! My name is Grace Lawley. I am a first-year Ph.D student in the [Computer Science & Electrical Engineering (CSEE)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/csee/) program at the [Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/) at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon.

I graduated from Lewis & Clark College in 2017 with a B.A. in Mathematics. My interests include discrete math, data science, computational linguistics, Rachmaninoff, ceramics, and the programming language R.

My research involves developing computational methods to detect and quantify atypical word use in the language of children with autism. Currently, I am working on compiling a childrenâ€™s speech corpus to use in my research. This endeavor has lead to me diving head first into the field of corpus linguistics, where I have been learning about the various methods for the compilation and normalization of spoken corpora.
